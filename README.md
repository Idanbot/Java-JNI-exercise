# Java-JNI-exercise

Java JNI simple exercise, comparing Java and CPP time difference in factorial calculations

## Instructions

1. JAVA_HOME has to be set under System environment variables, pointing to your JDK folder (I've used JDK 11.0.11)
2. In order to make compiling and linking easier, use exercise/makeJNI.bat to execute all the commands at ones (make sure paths are filenames are set correctly if you change anything)
3. at the end run the application in terminal with the command:
```
java Main
```
