# Java-JNI-exercise

Java JNI simple exercise, comparing Java and CPP time difference in factorial calculations

## Instructions

1. JAVA_HOME has to be set under System environment variables, pointing to your JDK folder (I've used JDK 11.0.11)
2. In order to make compiling and linking easier, use exercise/makeJNI.bat to execute all the commands at once.
(make sure paths and filenames are set correctly)
4. at the end run the application in terminal with the command:
```
java Main
```
